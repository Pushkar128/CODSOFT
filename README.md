# CODSOFT
Hello,
This repository is for my internship at CodSoft. I'll be uploading the AI tasks assigned to me during the internship here. I'm excited to learn and will do my best!

I recently accepted an internship program at CodSoft, where I was assigned four tasks to complete. Though I was required to finish at least three, I have only managed to complete one so far. While I understand the basics, I am still in the process of perfecting my skills. Although I could resort to copying and pasting to submit the remaining tasks, I believe it wouldn't benefit me in any meaningful way. Instead, I am committed to learning new skills and will strive to complete the tasks as soon as possible, even if it means risking rejection for not meeting the deadlines.
